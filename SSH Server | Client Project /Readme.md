<h1 align="center">Docker Containerized SSH Server and Client Project</h3>




<!-- PROJECT Details-->
## About The Project
In this project we will create two docker containers. One will be for our openssh server, and the other for our openssh client. 
We will establish a ssh connection from our client and access the server, this is a common practice in the cloud and demonstrates 
how to effectively spin up a docker container for the use off accessing a secure application. 





<!-- Benefits -->


## Benefits of SSH using containers
* Improved Security - SSH Establishes a secure and encypted connection between server and host which helps protects the application and data transmitted.

* Ease of management - Easily move from between different environments, making it easy to task, deploy, and scale the application. 

* Collaboration - Multiple team members ability to access an application simultaneously via SSH.

* Scalability - Spin up containers on demand when needed and shutdown when not. Optimizes resources and reduces cost due to flexibility.  

* Portability - Ease of use with multiple cloud providers and does not require dependences due to its packaging, not limited to environment specifics.



## Prerequisites

First we need to download the docker application from docker desktop. https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

I will use studio visual code as my IDE along with the docker extension, this will also work via shell on MAC, Linux or windows.




## Docker Container Installation
#### Container1 

1. In our terminal we first must download the docker image from docker hub.
    ```sh
     docker pull ubuntu
    ```
3. Now lets verify the docker image was installed. 
    ```sh
    docker images
    ```

    example output
   ```sh
    REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
    ubuntu       latest    xxxxxxxxxxx   7 weeks ago   77.8MB
   ```
5. Create a folder/directory named project1 where we will create our first container and change directory to project1.
    create directory
   ```sh
   mkdir project1
   ```
   ```sh
   cd project1
   ```

  
7. Now we will run the following command which will run the container. 
    ```sh
   docker run -it â€“name container1 ubuntu
    ```
